# wordle-helper
My first ever original program: a program to help you cheat on NYT's 'Wordle' game.

[Don't know what Wordle is? You should. Click here!](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

After learning regular expressions in python I had the idea to create this program to help me cheat... uhh.. I mean 'improve'... on Wordle.

There is a lot of room for improvement and will likely come back to this as I get better to make a prettier interface and more concise code/efficient code. 

I struggled with consolidating the loops for checking againsts multiple lists (the pattern-matched words plus the lists of included and excluded letters) and with being able to let the user start-over if they accidently selected an invalid number.
